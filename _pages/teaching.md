<h2 class="category">programming fundamentals</h2>
- From 1.2021 to 5.2021, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for UNC Chapel Hill's introductory programming course COMP 110, which sees enrollment upwards of 600 students every semester. I tutored students, debugged code, graded assignments, and provided personalized feedback on topics such as: 
    - data analysis with Jupyter and NumPy
    - algorithm development
    - Python syntax

<h2 class="category">complexity theory</h2>
- [YouTube Series: Models of Language and Computation](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh1XP0sUat7nhZb4B0PwOgEmBneaCcWoz), 1.2023 - Present
    - Intended to supplement content for UNC Chapel Hill's COMP455: Models of Language and Computation by diving deeper into real-life applications, and to provide an easy-to-understand resource for computer science students new to the wonders of complexity theory.
