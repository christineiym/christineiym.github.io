<h2 class="category">Programming Fundamentals</h2>
From 1.2021 to 5.2021, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for UNC Chapel Hill's introductory programming course COMP 110, which sees enrollment upwards of 600 students every semester. I tutored students on topics such as programming fundamentals, data analysis with Jupyter and NumPy, algorithm development, and Python syntax. I also debugged code, graded assignments, and provided personalized feedback.
