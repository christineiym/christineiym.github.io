I am an undergraduate ('24) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and in Nutrition at the [Gillings School of Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/). Under my research advisor, [Dr. Gary Bishop](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/), I lead a research initiative to create accessible campus maps known as [Luminary](https://www.linkedin.com/company/luminary-maps/), and have worked in augmentative and alternative communication and automating alternate literacy assessment systems.

Previously, I interned at [SAS Institute](https://www.sas.com/) for 1.5 years (5.2021 - 1.2023), conducting independent research to develop automation tools in Python, SQL, Spring Boot, and React for content delivery and code generation in the Education Division. 

Ask me about accessibility, data-focused advocacy, complexity theory, living with a disability, peer teaching in computer science, and getting involved in computer science research. Or ask me about faith, chemistry, poetry on computational complexity, work in Reddit's creator collection of Collectible Avatars, crocheting, photography, and music.

Or if you feel like it, talk with me about crawling up the steps of a campus administration building, growing up as a Filipino-American in the South, or how I once read the entire Harry Potter series in a week. It's all up to you!
