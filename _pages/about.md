_**keywords:** bridge-building, empowerment through technology, accessibility, advocacy, education, health_

I am a PhD Student at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute and a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (B.S. Computer Science '24, Highest Honors & Highest Distinction). Under my undergraduate research advisor, [Dr. Gary Bishop](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/), I led a research initiative to create accessible campus maps known as [Luminary](https://www.linkedin.com/company/luminary-maps/), and I have worked in augmentative and alternative communication and automating alternate literacy assessment systems.

Previously, I interned at [SAS Institute](https://www.sas.com/) for 1.5 years (5.2021 - 1.2023), conducting independent research to develop automation tools in Python, SQL, Spring Boot, and React for content delivery and code generation in the Education Division.

Ask me about accessibility, data-focused advocacy, complexity theory, living with a disability, peer teaching in computer science, and [getting involved in computer science research](https://christineiym.github.io/blog/2023/getting-involved-cs-research/). Or ask me about faith, chemistry, poetry on computational complexity, ongoing work in Reddit's creator collection of Collectible Avatars, crocheting, photography, and music.

Or if you feel like it, talk with me about crawling up the steps of a campus administration building to protest inaccessibility, moderating a Discord server of over 500 undergrads, growing up as a Filipino-American in the South, or reading the entire Harry Potter series in a week. It's up to you!
