I spent 1.5 years as an intern at SAS Institute, developing automation tools in Python, SQL, Spring Boot, and React to aid content delivery and test analysis in the Education Division. 

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for UNC Chapel Hill's introductory programming course COMP 110, which sees enrollment upwards of 600 students every semester.

I currently make YouTube videos explaining automata theory for fun.
